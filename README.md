# Ciro-A-Gluten-Free-Journey

This project is an iPad mobile game I developed for the WWDC student challenge. 
It is implemented in SpriteKit and GameplayKit using playground. The main focus here is the will to make people more aware about gluten intolerance, hoping this will help who is affected by this issue to be more integrated in our society.
